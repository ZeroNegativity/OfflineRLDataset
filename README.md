# Research Repository: How to Improve Synergy and Reduce Gap between Off-Policy and Offline RL: A Case Study in Gridworld Setting

This repository contains code developed as part of a research project conducted at Nazarbayev University. The research project focused on improving synergy and reducing the gap between off-policy and offline reinforcement learning (RL) in a gridworld setting.
